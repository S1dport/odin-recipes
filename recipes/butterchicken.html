    <h3>Butter chicken, traditionally known as murgh makhani, is an Indian dish. <br>It is a type of curry made from chicken with a spiced tomato and butter sauce.</h3>
    <h2>Ingredients: </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup butter</li>
        <li>1 minced onion</li>
        <li>1 tbsp minced garlic</li>
        <li>1 can tomato sauce</li>
        <li>3 cups heavy cream</li>
        <li>2 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1 tsp cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>1 tsp garam masala</li>
        <li>1.5 lb chicken breast, cut into bite sized chunks</li>
        <li>2 tbsp vegetable oil</li>
        <li>2 tbsp tandoori masala</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps: </h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a skillet over medium heat. Stir in onion and garlic, and cook slowly until the onion caramelizes to a dark brown, about 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, combine cream, tomato sauce, remaining butter, salt, cayenne pepper, and garam masala in a saucepan over medium-high heat; bring to a simmer. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 30 minutes. Stir in caramelized onions.</li>
        <li>While the sauce is simmering, toss chicken with vegetable oil until coated. Season with tandoori masala and spread out onto a baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Bake chicken in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center, about 12 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add cooked chicken to the sauce and simmer for 5 minutes before serving.</li>
    </ol>
